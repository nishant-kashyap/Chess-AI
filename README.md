# Chess-AI

## Objective:
The main objective for this project is to simulate a real chess game as
closely as possible. The input to the core of the program will most
likely be the 8 by 8 chessboard, and the output would be moves which
will be deemed best by the algorithms implemented.
A visual GUI makes the input/output interaction very easy so we will
be incorporating it in our project when it will be finally ready to
simulate a real chess game.
